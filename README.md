# Pentest Insights
#### CYBER SECURITY TOOL

**Pentest Insights** is a **Cyber Security Insights Tool** developed for the purposes of the developer's diploma thesis on 
Electrical & Computers Engineering. The tool offers Security Testing through Functional Testing and is an end-to-end 
**java project**.  

## Tech Information

The frontend is built with the [Vaadin Framework](https://vaadin.com/) which makes a
Progressive Web App, suitable both for desktop and mobile devices. On the backend side of the project we have
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 
for the repositories, entities and services combined with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for Functional Testing 
execution. To be more precise, Maven is embedded to the application through [Maven Embedder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-embedder/index.html) 
in order to execute a [Selenium Java](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) project with the desired functional tests.
The browser created for the functional tests execution proxies through an [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) instance.
As soon as Functional Testing has completed, the project drives the [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) instance through
it's [Java API](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-api-java) in order to perform several types of Crawling and Scanning on 
the targeted web application so that the most obvious security vulnerabilities are exploited and reported. The results
are presented both in graphical and comparative charts, as well as analytical grids.  
  
## Running the Project in Development Mode

`mvn spring-boot:run`

Wait for the application to start and point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ to view the application.

## Running the Project in Production Mode

`mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`

The default mode when the application is built or started is 'development'. The 'production' mode is turned on by 
passing the `production` argument when building or starting the app.

Note that if you switch between running in production mode and development mode, you need to do
```
mvn clean
```
before running in the other mode.
