#### CYBER SECURITY TOOL

**Pentest Insights** is a **Cyber Security Insights Tool** developed for the purposes of the developer's diploma thesis on 
Electrical & Computers Engineering. The tool offers **Security Testing** through **Functional Testing** and is an 
**end-to-end java project**.  

## Tech Information

The frontend is built with the [Vaadin Framework](https://vaadin.com/) which makes it a
Progressive Web App, suitable both for desktop and mobile devices. On the backend side of the project we have
[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) 
for the repositories, entities and services combined with [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) for Functional Testing 
execution. To be more precise, Maven is embedded into the application through 
[Maven Embedder](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.6.3/maven-embedder/index.html) 
in order to execute a [Selenium Java](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) project (located into the 
[security-project](https://github.com/johnfli/Pentest-Insights/tree/master/security-project) folder) with the desired 
functional tests.
The browser created for the functional tests' execution proxies through an [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) instance.
As soon as Functional Testing is completed, the project drives the [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) instance through
it's [Java API](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-api-java) in order to perform several types of Crawling and Scanning on 
the targeted web application so that the most obvious security vulnerabilities are exploited and reported. The results
are presented in graphical and comparative charts, as well as analytical grids. As for the database, an embedded 
[H2 Database](https://www.h2database.com/html/main.html) is used in order to provide more portability. This makes the 
whole project standalone, which that given the .jar into the root folder it should be able to run on any machine with
the single requirement of a [Java](https://openjdk.java.net/) JDK or JRE installed.
Note that the project has been pre-configured to connect to a [MySQL Database](https://www.mysql.com/) as well, thus 
switching to that configuration is as easy as uncommenting a couple of lines and commenting out a couple of others.
  
## Running/Packaging the Project in Development Mode

`mvn spring-boot:run`

Wait for the application to start and point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ to view the application.

`mvn clean package`

Wait for the package to complete and copy the .jar file from the target folder into the root folder, open a terminal
into the root folder and type the command `java -jar pentest-insights-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
 
Wait for the application to start and point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ to view the application.

## Running/Packaging the Project in Production Mode

`mvn spring-boot:run -Pproduction`

The default mode when the application is built or started is 'development'. The 'production' mode is turned on by 
passing the `production` argument when building or starting the app.

`mvn clean package -Pproduction`

Wait for the package to complete and copy the .jar file from the target folder into the root folder, open a terminal
into the root folder and type the command `java -jar pentest-insights-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`.
 
Wait for the application to start and point your browser at http://localhost:8000/ to view the application.

Note that if you switch between running in production mode and development mode, you need to do
```
mvn clean
```
before running in the other mode.
