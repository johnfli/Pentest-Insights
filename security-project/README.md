**Security Project** is a **standalone project** developed for the purposes of the developer's diploma thesis on 
Electrical & Computers Engineering. The project offers **Security Testing** through **Functional Testing** and is an 
**end-to-end java project**.  

## Tech Information

The [maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project utilizes [Selenium Java](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/) 
for the Functional Testing execution combined with [Boni Garcia's WebDriverManager](https://github.com/bonigarcia/webdrivermanager).
This combination minimizes  the requirements to only have the browsers installed. It is worth noting, at this point, 
that Functional Testing execution is done via [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/).
The browser created for the functional tests' execution proxies through an [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) instance.
As soon as Functional Testing is completed, the project drives the [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) instance through
it's [Java API](https://github.com/zaproxy/zap-api-java) in order to perform several types of Crawling and Scanning on 
the targeted web application so that the most obvious security vulnerabilities are exploited and reported. 

The [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) results and reports are automatically stored into the test-output folder (if ran 
through the testng.xml file the results will be in the target/surefire-reports folder). 

The [OWASP ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org/) results and reports are automatically stored into the reports folder.
  
## Running the Project

Open a ZAP instance and configure the Proxy Port to listen on the same host ip and port number as the configuration
inside the config.properties file in src/test/resources, then open a terminal in the security-project folder and 
instruct the command:

`mvn clean install` OR `mvn clean test`

Wait for the application to start and a browser of your configuration (property "browser" inside the config.properties 
file) should pop-up (on condition that headlessEnabled is configured to OFF), perform all the tests on your targeted 
web app and finally you should see the ZAP instance driven by the program. The types of scanning that ZAP will perform 
onto the targeted web app are also configured by the properties inside the config.properties file:

|    ZAP Option    |         Enable        |         Disable        |
|------------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
|     Crawling     |    spiderEnabled=ON   |    spiderEnabled=OFF   |
|  AJAX Spidering  |  ajaxSpiderEnabled=ON |  ajaxSpiderEnabled=OFF |
| Passive Scanning | passiveScanEnabled=ON | passiveScanEnabled=OFF |
|  Active Scanning |  activeScanEnabled=ON |  activeScanEnabled=OFF |
